# 🚗 Car Selling Website — Frontend

A modern car sales platform with a complete customer buying flow: browsing cars, comparison, checkout, contract signing, payment, and customer portal.

The frontend is built using **React + Vite**, with Ant Design, TailwindCSS, React Router, and Axios—all fully integrated with backend authentication, order processing, contract signing, and payment logic.
